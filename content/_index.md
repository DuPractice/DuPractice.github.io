I am a second-year M.Phil. student in Social Science at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, supervised by Professor [Li Han](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=li-han-lihan). My primary interest lies in international political economy, China in the world, and environmental politics. I hold a B.A. in International Politics and English from Shandong University. When I'm not in front of the screen, you can find me swimming, reading, or practicing rap.
