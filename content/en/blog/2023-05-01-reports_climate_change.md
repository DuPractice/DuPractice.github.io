That can create misaligned incentives.
    2. A lot of climate messaging focuses on the need to prevent catastrophe.

    1. The reason these one-off payments, known as anticipatory cash relief, matter now is that disasters are being supersized by human-induced climate change, and they’re often inflicting the most pain on the poorest people in the world.

People can lose their only means to make a living, their land, and their only assets, livestock animals.
