## Why the GEE?

Data from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) is getting more and more popular in social science research. As a cloud-based geospatial analysis platform, GEE provides various geospatial remote sensing collections, such as forestation, climate monitoring, and land cover data. (Gorelick et al. 2017)[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425717302900#s0015] listed the most frequently used datasets in the GEE. 

GEE has been used to address several societal issues. For example, in 2013, (Hansen et al.)[https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1244693] examined global Landsat data at a 30-meter spatial resolution to characterize forest extent, loss, and gain from 2000 to 2012. This method is also applied in one publication in the Quarterly Journal of Economics, Burgess et al., (2012) utilized the MODIS sensor to construct the measurement of forest loss. The list is not exclusive and the application of satellite data  in social science is still under exploration.  


## Get Started!

To use Google Earth Engine (GEE),  we need to visit the (Google Earth Engine website)[earthengine.google.com] and register for noncommercial usage.

Here, you are suggested to register by using your .edu email and filling in the affiliated institution correctly. The request would be approved very quickly for noncommercial users.

{{<figure src="/media/en_blog/2023-08-22-GEE-1/pic2.png" caption="Registration " width="450">}}

After being admitted, we will see the interface like this and click "Try the Code Editor", it will automatically transfer you into the new interface.

In the middle of the interface is the "New Script" module, where you can type the code and execute them. In other words, it is the Earth Engine (JavaScript API)[https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/getstarted]. Users could program and run the code in the window and request the data via API. However, if you are more comfortable with using Python, then, here I recommend visiting the GEE via (Python API)[https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/python_install]. And if you are using Google Colab, the latest version of the Earth Engine Python client library has already been installed (via pip). 


##  Convert the JavaScript into Python scripts

Many GEE tutorials are written in JavaScript, if you are not familiar to the syntax of JavaScript, that could be a hindrance. Moreover,
even though you are familiar with the syntax of JavaScript, which is similar to the Python script, manually editing the files could be intense. A good idea is to run the package geemap and get the conversion automatically.

Here is the code provided by (Prof. Wu)[https://github.com/giswqs]:
Notice here is, if the JavaScript is complex, the conversion could be error. 

```python
import os
from geemap.conversion import *

# Create a temporary working directory
work_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'geemap')
# Get Earth Engine JavaScript examples. There are five examples in the geemap package folder. 
# Change js_dir to your own folder containing your Earth Engine JavaScripts, such as js_dir = '/path/to/your/js/folder'
js_dir = get_js_examples(out_dir=work_dir) 

# Convert all Earth Engine JavaScripts in a folder recursively to Python scripts.
js_to_python_dir(in_dir=js_dir, out_dir=js_dir, use_qgis=True)
print("Python scripts saved at: {}".format(js_dir))

# Convert all Earth Engine Python scripts in a folder recursively to Jupyter notebooks.
nb_template = get_nb_template()  # Get the notebook template from the package folder.
py_to_ipynb_dir(js_dir, nb_template)

# Execute all Jupyter notebooks in a folder recursively and save the output cells.
execute_notebook_dir(in_dir=js_dir)
```
