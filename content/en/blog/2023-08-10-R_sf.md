## Chapter 2. [Vector Data Handling with sf](https://tmieno2.github.io/R-as-GIS-for-Economists/vector-basics.html)

sf 

do not need to create simple feature geometry from scratch. 

An important feature of an sf object is that it is basically a data.frame with geometric information stored as a variable (column). This means that transforming an sf object works just like transforming a data.frame. Basically, everything you can do to a data.frame, you can do to an sf as well.


```r

# ------ Foundamentals  ------ #
# read shp file
eez <- read_sf('eez_v11.shp')

# writing to a shp file
st_write(eez, layer = 'eez2')

# alternative way to save shp file in R
saveRDS(eez, ''eez2.rds'')

# extract geometry column
st_geometry(eez[1, ])[[1]][[1]]
geometry <- st_geometry(eez)

# plot it
plot(st_geometry(eez[1, ]))

# register df as an sf object
st_as_sf()

# check the current CRS
st_crs(eez)

# turn a df with geographic coordinates into sf, (usually is a set of points) 
well <â€“ import('well.csv')
well.sf <- well \%\>\%
	st_as_sf(coords = c('longitude', 'latitude'), crs = st_crs(eez)) 

# remove geometry
well <- well.sf \%\>\%
	st_drop_geometry() 

# transfer the CRS
eez2 <- st_transform(eez, st_crs(eez)) # keep two sf objects using the same CRS is important for interacting or mapping them.

# quick view
plot(eez\$geometry) # using plot() rather ggplot() for a quick look 

# interactive view
pic_eez <- tm_shape(eez) + tm_polygons()  # first to create a static map
tmap_leaflet(pic_eez)


# ------ Geometrical operations ------ #

# create buffer
wells_buffer <- st_buffer(well.sf, dist = 1600) # 1600 meters

tm_shape(wells_buffer) +
  tm_polygons() +
  tm_shape(well.sf) +
  tm_symbols(col = "red", size = 0.1) +
  tm_layout(frame = NA)
  
 
 # calculate the area of polygons
 # useful to construct area-weighted average of characteristics after spatially joining two polygon layers
 eez_area <- mutate(eez, area = as.numeric(st_area(eez)))  

# st_union (not keep) and st_combine (keep the internal borders)

# st_simplify and ms_simplify
# Sometimes, a vector data is excessively detailed for your purpose. In such cases, you can simplify the spatial object using st_simplify() so that you can render the map much faster.
object.size(eez)
eez <- read_sf('eez_v11.shp') %>%
  select(TERRITORY1, ISO_TER1, SOVEREIGN1) %>%
  st_make_valid() %>%
  group_by(SOVEREIGN1) %>%
  summarise(geometry = st_union(geometry)) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  st_simplify(preserveTopology = T, dTolerance = 1000)
  
  #However, st_simplify() does not respect the internal borders. To simplify only the outer borders, use rmapshaper::ms_simplify(). The keep option controls the degree of simplifcation (the lower, the more simplified).

eez <- read_sf('eez_v11.shp') %>%
  select(TERRITORY1, ISO_TER1, SOVEREIGN1) %>%
  st_make_valid() %>%
  group_by(SOVEREIGN1) %>%
  summarise(geometry = st_union(geometry)) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  ms_simplify(keep = 0.01)

```
