This is a final project for MGCS5022 (Political Economy of China). By analyzing text data on 19943 court judgments and 34669 defendants in 32 provinces from 2008 to 2016, I want to answer two questions. First, whether women in China commit fewer corruption activities than men; and second, (if there is a gender gap) why there is a gender gap in corruption.
