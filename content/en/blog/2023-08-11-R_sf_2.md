## [Chapter 3. Spatial Interactions of Vector Data: Subsetting and Joining](https://tmieno2.github.io/R-as-GIS-for-Economists/int-vv.html)

3.2 Spatial Subsetting
Could help researchers to narrow down the geographic scope of analysis.

```r

# ------ Subsetting  ------ #

# select only the grid that intersect with eez
grid_1 <- grid[eez,]  # the default underlying topological relations is st_intersects()
grid_2 <- grid[eez, , op = st_within] # change op = 


# ------ Joining(will still use the target gis) ------ #
# point(target) vs polygon(source)
st_join(wells, eez) # target first

# polygons vs polysons

IA_corn <- readRDS("Data/IA_corn.rds")
IA_corn
tm_shape(IA_corn) +
  tm_polygons(col = "acres") +
  tm_layout(frame = FALSE, legend.outside = TRUE)
  
HUC_IA <- 
  st_read("Data/huc250k.shp") %>% 
  dplyr::select(HUC_CODE) %>% 
  st_transform(st_crs(IA_corn)) %>% 
  #--- select HUC units that overlaps with IA ---#
  .[IA_corn, ]
  
tm_shape(IA_corn) +
  tm_polygons(col = "acres") +
tm_shape(HUC_IA) +
  tm_polygons(alpha = 0) +
  tm_layout(frame = FALSE, legend.outside = TRUE)
  
HUC_joined <- st_join(HUC_IA, IA_corn) 
  
# ------ Intersection(will create new gis) ------ #
# Also, we just saw that area-weighted averages cannot be found using st_join() because it does not provide information about how much area of each HUC unit is intersecting with each of its intersecting counties. If we can get the geometry of the intersecting part of the HUC unit and the county, then we can calculate its area, which in turn allows us to find area-weighted averages of joined attributes. 

HUC_intersections <- st_intersection(HUC_IA, IA_corn) %>% 
  mutate(huc_county = paste0(HUC_CODE, "-", county_code)

tm_shape(filter(HUC_intersections, HUC_CODE == "10170203")) + 
  tm_polygons(col = "huc_county") +
  tm_layout(frame = FALSE)
  
HUC_aw_acres <- HUC_intersections %>% 
  #--- get area ---#
  mutate(area = as.numeric(st_area(.))) %>% 
  #--- get area-weight by HUC unit ---#
  group_by(HUC_CODE) %>% 
  mutate(weight = area / sum(area)) %>% 
  #--- calculate area-weighted corn acreage by HUC unit ---#
  summarize(aw_acres = sum(weight * acres))
    

```
