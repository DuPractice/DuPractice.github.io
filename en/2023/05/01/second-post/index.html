, for instance, found that voters reward politicians for delivering emergency relief for natural disasters, but not for investing in natural-disaster preparedness — even though $1 spent on preparedness was worth approximately $15 in emergency response. That can create misaligned incentives.</li><li>A lot of climate messaging focuses on the need to prevent catastrophe. But the floods and mudslides and smoke-filled air and deadly heat are a reminder that climate change is already worsening disasters and factoring into new ones. The question is whether that will make the future seem closer and generate new political will for preventing harm, not just reacting to it.</li></ol></li><li>Summer Heat Waves Killed 61,000 in Europe Last Year, Study Says, NYT, Jul/10/2023, <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/10/climate/heat-waves-europe-deaths.html target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">link</a>

.<ol><li>The reason these one-off payments, known as anticipatory cash relief, matter now is that disasters are being supersized by human-induced climate change, and they’re often inflicting the most pain on the poorest people in the world. When crops or property are uninsured, sudden disasters like floods, or a slow ones, like droughts, can be ruinous. People can lose their only means to make a living, their land, and their only assets, livestock animals.</li></ol></li><li>Lithium Scarcity Pushes Carmakers Into the Mining Business, NYT, Jul/2/2023, <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/02/business/lithium-mining-automakers-electric-vehicles.html target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">link</a>
