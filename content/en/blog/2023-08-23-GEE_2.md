In this document, I will give an example to display how to download satellite data via Python API, and I will use Colab to program.

## Case: Download Landsat 7 Collection 1 Tier 1 Annual NDVI Composite

[Earth Engine Data Catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog) already lists all available collections. You can easily search out the one your project needs. 

Actually, selecting appropriate collections could be a challenge if you are not familiar with the satellite data. 

Here I will use [Landsat 7 Collection 1 Tier 1 Annual NDVI Composite](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/LANDSAT_LE07_C01_T1_ANNUAL_NDVI#bands) as an example.

Note that this collection uses the computed top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. Compared with the one used surface reflectance, TOA production presents the amount of sunlight that is reflected back into space by the Earth's surface and atmosphere without any atmospheric correction or consideration of the effects of topography. Simply speaking, the result of this collection will be disturbed by the clouds.

## Code

1. Connect with the google drive

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```
2. Import the packages

```python
try:
    import geemap
except ModuleNotFoundError:
    if 'google.colab' in str(get_ipython()):
        print("package not found, installing w/ pip in Google Colab...")
        !pip install geemap
    else:
        print("package not found, installing w/ conda...")
        !conda install mamba -c conda-forge -y
        !mamba install geemap -c conda-forge -y
    import geemap
    
import ee
import os
import geopandas as gpd
## if there is no shapefile in the google drive, we could import the administrative unit shapefile from package pygadm
!pip install pygadm 
import pygadm
``` 

3. Initialize the geemap

```python
try:
        ee.Initialize()
except Exception as e:
        ee.Authenticate()
        ee.Initialize()
```
{{<figure src="/media/en_blog/2023-08-22-GEE-2/pic1.png" caption="Authenticate" width="900">}}
Just click the link and proceed accordingly.

4. Select the area of interest

```python
#the file path in my google drive
shapefile_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/IDN_adm/IDN_adm1.shp'  
# read the shapefile
gdf = gpd.read_file(shapefile_path) 
# print the column names of the shapefile
print(gdf.head()) 

# Filter the attribute data based on a condition
Riau = gdf[gdf['NAME_1'] == 'Riau']
print(Riau.head())
# Convert GeoDataFrame to Earth Engine FeatureCollection
Riau = geemap.geopandas_to_ee(Riau)
```

5. Draw the interactive map

```python
Map = geemap.Map()
Map.addLayer(Riau)
Map
```
{{<figure src="/media/en_blog/2023-08-22-GEE-2/pic2.png" caption="Map" width="900">}}

I strongly recommend mapping first, in order to ensure the area of interest. 

6. Output the image

```python

for year in range(1999,2017):
  d1 = str(year)+"-01-"+"01"
  d2 = str(year)+"-12-"+"01"
  print(d1)
  Date_start = ee.Date(d1)
  Date_end = ee.Date(d2)
  # filter the image which we are interested in
    images = ee.ImageCollection("LANDSAT/LE07/C01/T1_ANNUAL_NDVI") \ # import the ImageCollections
    .filterDate(Date_start, Date_end) \ #filter the date
    .select(['NDVI']) # select the band
  
    type(images)
  # now the *images* is an ee.ImageCollection, needs to be converted into ee.image
  
  # convert to array
  array = images.toArray()
  # convert to an image
  bandNames = images.aggregate_array('system:index')
  image = array.arrayProject([0]).arrayFlatten([bandNames])
  
  print(image.getInfo())

 # output the image
  task = ee.batch.Export.image.toDrive(image=image,
                 description='NDVI_' +str(year), # image name
                 folder='new_tmp', # folder will be automatically constructed in google drive
                 scale=30, #resolution
                 region = Riau.geometry(),
                 fileFormat='GeoTIFF',
                 maxPixels=1e12)
  task.start()
```

```python
task.status() #could test the output process
```
{{<figure src="/media/en_blog/2023-08-22-GEE-2/pic3.png" caption="Map" width="900">}}

If the task proceeds successfully, you could see it in the GEE task [manager](https://code.earthengine.google.com/tasks).

## Conclusion

1. Here I only provide the solution in Colab. Actually, we could also program in the GEE Javascript API.
2. In this example, I select Riau as the area of interest. It is a province in Indonesia. 
3. However, if the area of interest is big, say, a country. Then, it may reach the limitation of the number of output pixels and report errors. 
4. The default storage of google drive is 15 GB, considering the satellite data is large, upgrading the storage is necessary.
