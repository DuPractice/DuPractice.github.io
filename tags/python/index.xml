Data from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) is getting more and more popular in social science research. As a cloud-based geospatial analysis platform, GEE provides various geospatial remote sensing collections, such as forestation, climate monitoring, and land cover data. (Gorelick et al. 2017)[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425717302900#s0015] listed the most frequently used datasets in the GEE.
GEE has been used to address several societal issues. For example, in 2013, (Hansen et al.</description></item><item><title>When a R user began coding with Python III</title><link>https://dupractice.github.io/en/2023/07/28/bookdown-tips/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jul 2023 16:00:21 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://dupractice.github.io/en/2023/07/28/bookdown-tips/</guid><description>In this document, we continue our study on basics of Python.
Method In Python, a method is a function that is associated with an object. It only works with that object It is used with dot notation: object.method()

the IDEs, mathematical operations, basic data types, variables, branching, and iteration comparison and logical operators This document In this document, we push forward the learning process and focus on four data structures used to store and organize data: list, dictionary, and tuple.
List: A list is an ordered collection of items, and it can contain elements of different data types.</description></item><item><title>When a R user began coding with Python I</title><link>https://dupractice.github.io/en/2023/07/20/bookdown-tips/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2023 16:00:21 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://dupractice.github.io/en/2023/07/20/bookdown-tips/</guid><description>Excited to start my journey in Python!
I am a R user and always tell myself it is already enough to master one language. But this summer I attended to the ICPSR Sumer Program in Quantitative Methods and enrolled several exciting courses, such as Text Analysis and the Introduction to Python. I thought itâ€™s time to learn something new!
Why Python? Actually, I learn Python because I want to push forward one of my text-analysis projects, which I need to scrap data from Weibo first.</description></item></channel></rss>
